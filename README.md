# React Micro Frontend Hook

_v0.1.0_

This component is designed to be used to import Micro Frontend libraries. To read more about Micro Frontends, have a read of the article by Martin Fowler:
https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html.

The library takes inspiration from the work by [@Sackrin](https://github.com/sackrin)'s MicroUI project, but with a slightly different approach. Be sure to check the similar [repository](https://github.com/sackrin/react-micro-ui-hooks) for alternative implementation.

There will be more explanations on the difference later.

## Installation

This library is currently in **beta**, so it's not publish on NPM yet. You can, however, use it directly as an npm module using the github import.

## Usage
